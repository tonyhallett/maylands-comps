	    "node": ">=18.0.0 || >=20.0.0"

scripts

There are 3 scripts for running the code in a browser
"start"
"start-device"
"start-hosting"

start and start-device both use parcel for HMR.
The difference is that start-device makes the emulator to a device that uses the local machine address that is 
added to env.device.
start-hosting does this too but does not support HMR so no need to use this one.
start and start-device use exec so to stop the emulator close the parcel server with Ctrl C in the terminal.
start-hosting use start and Ctrl C agin needs to be used in the terminal to stop the emulators.

All 3 require connection to the database emulator as do the tests.
The connectDatabaseEmulator function call uses process.env.EMULATOR_HOST
When using start, start-device and start-hosting parcel provides this via the .env.device and .env.serve environment files.
Parcel is instructed to use these with
cross-env NODE_ENV=device parcel
cross-env NODE_ENV=serve
The script add-device-address-to-env.ts ensures the address is correct.

In testing the jest.config.ts file sets process.env.EMULATOR_HOST = "127.0.0.1";
